# everoute-web - Simple Web Service for [everoute](https://github.com/dertseha/everoute)

This simple web service acts as a shell for the everoute library to provide a routing capability in the context of [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/).

**This project is discontinued. My interest in EVE has dropped again and based on experience, it'll take some years until I might resub. Furthermore interest in this library was low, which is why I keep it as a project for experience.**
